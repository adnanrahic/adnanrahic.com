      <description>Handling large images has always been a pain in my side since I started writing code. Lately, it has started to have a huge impact on page speed and SEO ranking. If your website has poorly optimized images it won&amp;rsquo;t score well on Google Lighthouse. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t score well, it won&amp;rsquo;t be on the first page of Google. That sucks.
TL;DR I&amp;rsquo;ve built and open-sourced a snippet of code that automates the process of creating and deploying an image resize function and an S3 bucket with one simple command.</description>

      <description>Being a developer is amazing. Writing code, solving problems and thinking of ingenious solutions for complicated algorithms is what we live for. But, the grass is not always so green on this side of the fence. Sooner or later you need to get your hands dirty and deploy the app you worked so hard on. Deployments are not always easy. To be blunt, they can be incredibly hard and time-consuming.</description>
