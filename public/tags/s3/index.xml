      <description>Handling large images has always been a pain in my side since I started writing code. Lately, it has started to have a huge impact on page speed and SEO ranking. If your website has poorly optimized images it won&amp;rsquo;t score well on Google Lighthouse. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t score well, it won&amp;rsquo;t be on the first page of Google. That sucks.
TL;DR I&amp;rsquo;ve built and open-sourced a snippet of code that automates the process of creating and deploying an image resize function and an S3 bucket with one simple command.</description>
