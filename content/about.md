<h2>A word or two about me</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Currently working remote as a Developer Evangelist at a crazy successful observability SaaS based out of Brooklyn, NYC called <a href="https://sematext.com/" target="_blank">Sematext.com</a>. Hell bent on creating the most beautiful observability, logging, and debugging platform ever.
</p> 
<p>
    My passion is teaching. I've taught JavaScript, DevOps, and Serverless topics at various venues. But, one place will always be special. The <a href="http://www.academy387.com/lecturers/adnan-rahic" target="_blank">Academy387.com</a> in Sarajevo is where I give back to my community in Sarajevo. My love for teaching was channeled into creating the first online learning startup in my home city of Sarajevo called <a href="https://bookvar.co/" target="_blank">Bookvar.co</a> which is still active today.
</p>
<p>
    Recently I published my first eBook <a href="https://sematext.com/resources/nodejs-monitoring-ebook/">"Node.js Monitoring: The Complete Guide"</a>. Check it out!
</p>
<p>
    I'm a published author with an online video course about learning <a href="http://bit.ly/sls-js">"Serverless JavaScript by Example"</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I spent two years as the campsite leader in my local <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.sarajevo/" target="_blank">@freeCodeCamp</a> community before handing the torch over younger members. It's their time to shine.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a passionate reader, down to earth writer, with several published articles in the largest tech publications on the Internet, including <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/news/author/adnanrahic" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@adnanrahic" target="_blank">HackerNoon</a>, and <a href="https://dev.to/@adnanrahic" target="_blank">Dev.to</a>.

<h2>My Toolbox</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    JavaScript is my language of choice. I've been creating full-stack JavaScript software for nearly five years. The most life changing event in my life was getting introduced to Node.js, and of course reading "Eloquent JavaScript" from cover to cover. This can only outweigh the moment I started exploring serverless architectures. Now, people keep calling me an <i>influencer</i> in the field of serverless. I still don't know how to feel about this.

    As a Developer Evangelist, and speaker, I get in touch with a lot of people who are in need of a mentor. Most of them just need someone to talk to about code. Don't we all? Feel free to shoot me a tweet or a direct message if you want to chat. Or, if you're ever in Sarajevo, please be sure to let me know, I'm always down for drinks.
