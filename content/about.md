<h2>Summary</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Currently working remote as a Developer Advocate at a booming startup based out of Tallinn called <a href="https://dashbird.io/" target="_blank">Dashbird.io</a>. Hell bent on creating the most beautiful Serverless monitoring and debugging platform ever.
</p> 
<p>
    I found that my passion is teaching. I often teach JavaScript mainly at the  <a href="http://www.academy387.com/lecturers/adnan-rahic" target="_blank">Academy387.com</a> - a premium IT educational facility in Sarajevo. The love of teaching was also channeled in creating the first online learning startup in my home city of Sarajevo called <a href="https://bookvar.co/" target="_blank">Bookvar.co</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Recently I published on online video course about learning <a href="http://bit.ly/sls-js">"Serverless JavaScript by Example"</a>. Check it out!
</p>
<p>
    In my free time I volounteer as a campsite leader in my local <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.sarajevo/" target="_blank">@freeCodeCamp</a> community. This is my way of giving back.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a passionate reader, down to earth writer, with several published articles in the largest publications on Medium, including <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank">Hacker Noon</a>.

<h2>My Toolbox</h2>

<p>
    JavaScript is my language of choice. I've been creating full-stack JavaScript software for nearly three years. Loving the MEAN Stack and anything regarding Node.js. The most life changing event in my life was in fact getting introduced to Nodejs, and of course reading "Eloquent JavaScript" from cover to cover. This can only outweigh the moment I started exploring serverless architectures. Now, people keep calling me an <i>influencer</i> in the field of serverless. I still don't know how to feel about this.

    As a tech. evangelist, and freeCodeCamp local leader, I get in touch with a lot of people who are in need of a mentor. Most of them just need someone to talk to about code. Don't we all? Feel free to shoot me a tweet or a direct message if you want to chat. Or, if you're ever in Sarajevo, please be sure to let me know, I'm always down for drinks.
