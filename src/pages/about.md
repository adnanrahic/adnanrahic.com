## Currently Working As

I'm a Staff Developer Advocate at [Tracetest.io](https://www.tracetest.io), where I get to lead our developer relations efforts and make end-to-end testing easier with real data. Alongside this, I'm also working with Kubeshop, an open-source accelerator building tools for Kubernetes developers. Between Tracetest, Monokle, Kusk, Testkube, and Botkube, it’s exciting to be a part of a team that’s bringing meaningful tools to the Kubernetes community.

## My Journey So Far

Over the years, I’ve held some pretty amazing roles in developer advocacy, software engineering, and even co-founded my own startup. Before my current role, I was a Senior Developer Advocate at Cube, one of the biggest names in Headless BI for data applications. Working there allowed me to dive deep into building scalable data applications, handling complex data modeling, and integrating analytics with web applications.

Going further back, I spent a few years as a Software Engineer and Technology Evangelist at Sematext Group, Inc., where I worked on Sematext Cloud—an infrastructure and application performance monitoring solution and [Logagent](https://github.com/sematext/logagent-js)—a lightweight log shipper. It was a great mix of monitoring, consulting, and training, all designed to give businesses a complete look at their systems.

## Teaching & Community Involvement

Teaching is my thing, and giving back to the community has always been a big part of who I am. I’ve taught JavaScript, DevOps, and Serverless at places like Academy387 in Sarajevo, which holds a special place in my heart. Inspired to make a bigger impact, I co-founded [Bookvar.co](https://bookvar.co), Sarajevo’s first online learning platform, to revolutionize education here in Bosnia. And during my time as a Microsoft Student Partner, I ran workshops, hackathons, and demos to foster a love for tech among students.

## What I’ve Published

Writing and creating content is another way I love to share what I know. Recently, I published an eBook, *Node.js Monitoring: The Complete Guide,* perfect for anyone getting serious about Node.js. I also put together an online video course called *Serverless JavaScript by Example,* a hands-on guide to serverless. And I’ve been fortunate to write articles featured on some major platforms like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com), and [Dev.to](https://dev.to), along with some work for Packt Publishing.

## My Toolbox

If it’s JavaScript or Node.js, I’m all in. I’ve spent over five years building full-stack JavaScript applications, and I can trace my passion for it back to reading *Eloquent JavaScript,* which truly changed the way I approach coding. Lately, people have started calling me an influencer in serverless, and while it’s still surreal to hear, it’s great to see the impact this tech is having. Some of my favorite tools are JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, AWS, Linux, DevOps, and Serverless. Beyond that, I’m diving deeper into TDD, CI/CD pipelines, and building clusters that scale.

## Giving Back & Speaking

I’m a big believer in open-source and have contributed to various projects, published npm modules, and kept system-level monitoring tools up to date. Conferences and meetups are another place you’ll often find me, sharing what I know and learning from others. I also led the freeCodeCamp community in my area for a couple of years, and I’m still cheering on the next wave of developers taking up the reins.
